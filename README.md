Data Minig & analysis with classification algorithm in R programming:

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 
million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide.. Heart failure is a common
event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease.
People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more
risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection 
and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.


Using classificationn model i have achieved accuracy of 87%.
